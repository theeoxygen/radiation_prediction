# radiation_prediction
To summarize what is going on in my data, there is a gama telescope and all these energy perticles that are hitting the telescope.
There is a camera recording the patterns of how this light is hitting the telescope/camera.
We therefore can use the properties of these patterns to define which type of particle caused the radiation.
